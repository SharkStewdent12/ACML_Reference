(IMPORTANT: the data set is a improved and extended version of the one used in CVPR 2007 by same authors)

This data set contains images collected from EBAY auction site (www.ebay.com). The set contains four sets classes: cars, shoes, dresses, and pottery. Each class contains 12 images for each of the eleven basic color terms: black, blue, brown, grey, green, orange, pink, purple, red, white, yellow. The color names are given to the images by EBAY users. The first ten images of each colored object are used for testing, the last two as a validation set. 

For each image we have hand-segmented the object areas which correspond to the color name. The segmentations are based on a segmentation algorithm which not always correctly detected object boundaries, resulting in some erroneous segmentations.
